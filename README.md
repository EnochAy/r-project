KPMG Predictive Analytics (Virtual Internship)

This is my first data science project in predictive analysis

Based on the data sets collected from the organization, 
data quality assurance was carried out. Thereafter, 
data transformation and feature engineering was done. 
I then moved on to building and tuning models, using the generalized regression model in R. The
customer with the highest possible value was recommended to the organization. Finally, the
Tableau was used to present the insights from data.
Skill sets acquired through these projects include 
the following: 
Data Quality Assessment;
Customer Segmentation;
Data Insights; and
Data Insights and Presentation
